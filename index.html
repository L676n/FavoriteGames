                <p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, 
                buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend against
                hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel,
                a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States.
                The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment and briefly controls Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence.
